[{"slug":"README","category":"blog","body":"# Astro - Ink\r\nCrisp, minimal, personal blog theme for Astro\r\n\r\n<img src=\"./public/astro-banner.png\" alt=\"Astro Banner\" />\r\n\r\n\r\nAstro Ink is a minimal theme created to serve minimalistic markdown-based blog needs. It ships with almost all the basic Astro components that you might need while creating light-weight, performant, personal blogs, that focus on shipping less Javascript by default.\r\n\r\nIt's hugely inspired by [Hugo](https://github.com/knadh/hugo-ink)'s Ink theme and strives to remain light, while providing the basis for a beautiful, minimal blog.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- __Minimal, Crisp, Markdown-Blog Ready__\r\n- __Uses `astro@next`__ - It uses Astro's [next](https://next.docs.astro.build/getting-started) APIs under the hood\r\n- __Svelte Ready__ - In its effort to remain light-weight, performant, and more approachable from Astro's POV, Svelte is used for interactive components like the theme switcher\r\n- __Modular__ - The structure is highly modular, with components doing just one job, and one job well.\r\n- __Collection + Dynamic Pages__ - It's ready with Next.js like dynamic pages, to support a tag-based classification system with paginated results, all configurable\r\n- __Dark Mode & Color Codes (beta)__ - It supports dark mode, and 6+ color modes that could be configured using `tailwind.config.js`. Remember to restart when developing, and enable just one group of colors at a time. To customize the blog section, add any of the Tailwind Typography's `prose-{color}` classes as referred [here](./src/components/Prose.astro)\r\n- __Netlify CMS<sup>*NEW</sup>__ - Add/Edit/Update all the posts in the `/blog` directory by visiting `your-site.netlify.com/admin` ex: [astro-ink.netlify.app/admin](https://astro-ink.netlify.app/admin) with your Netlify credentials. It needs Netlify Identity(https://app.netlify.com/sites/your-site/settings/identity#registration\r\n) and Git Gateway(https://app.netlify.com/sites/your-site/settings/identity#services) enabled. (_Write-up coming soon!_)\r\n- __Future Posts<sup>*NEW</sup>__(with Github Actions) - Create posts in the `/src/drafts` directory with a future `date` in the `YYYY-MM-DD` format, and let a specially crafted [Github Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/ssg-publish-drafts) take care of auto-publishing it on your specified date. You can configure the check interval in [Github Action](https://github.com/one-aalam/astro-ink/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml).(_Write-up coming soon!_)\r\n- __Client-Side Search<sup>*NEW</sup>__ - Allow your users get to your blog posts quickly with client-side search feat.

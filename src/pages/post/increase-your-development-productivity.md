# Increase your development productivity with this one package.

When working in development we spend a lot of cloning packages, installing packages and opening visual studio code. My usual workflow goes like the following:

1. git clone
2. cd project 
3. yarn
4. code . 
5. yarn dev
6. development time!

When one of my discord members `cryptus_neoxysðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³` told me about a project he had been working on called [`git-ultimate-cloner`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/git-ultimate-cloner) , it allowed you to clone, install packages and open visual studio code (or your favorite ide) in a single command. It hit 100k downloads this week! 

### How does it work?

First you install the package globally `npm i -g git-ultimate-cloner` and then you can use the following command:
```
quick clone <repository-url>
```
This will then do all of this work flow, allowing you to get working quickly without having to do it all manually. 

#### Using a default directory

I develop everything in the same directory named development, `git-ultimate-cloner` allows you to set a default directory. Even if you open in your root directory it will always clone to that directory for example:

```
quick --set-folder default "C:\development\development"
```
Then if you need a one off directory you can do the following:

```
quick clone <repo-link> --folder current
```
and that will clone it to the current directory. 

You should 100% check this out, it's one of my favorite new projects and I am super proud of the discord member who created this project.
